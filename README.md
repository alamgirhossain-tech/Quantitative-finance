# Quantitative-finance
Quantitative Finance - Technical Analysis to Value at Risk Utilizing US and Denmark Stocks. This repository is not a theoretical that explains each indicator's smallest details. This notebook focuses on applying finance to many variables to provide a practical education. This report does not address every facet of finance. The repo, for instance, is centered on technical, quantitative, and risk analysis of the stock market, but it does not cover all avenues. This repository does not include futures and options, Montecarlo Simulations, or binomial trees. This is because this repository aspires to be beginner to advanced level. Regarding the advanced level, there are significantly more extensive books on these topics. This repository is not intend to teach the reader programming language. It describes how to program a portfolio, a MACD, a VaR, and other financial instruments in the most efficient manner. In addition, the code is clear and concise, preventing the reader from becoming overwhelmed with programming. I really believe that we can learn to program if we begin with the fundamentals, and this repository seeks to facilitate this.
